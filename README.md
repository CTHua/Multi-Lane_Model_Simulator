## Install
`git clone https://github.com/CTHua/Multi-Lane_Model_Simulator.git` to your folder

**If you want to excute the demo program**
You have to install `ncurses API`, install it by **homebrew** or **apt-get**.
Then you just need to `make` and run the program named `x_lane_demo`.

## Data
**excute the `x_lane_data` program.**
### One Lane 
data format
